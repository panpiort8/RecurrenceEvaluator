# RecurrenceEvaluator

Packet provides utilities to evaluate numerical values of recurrence equations.
Because of recurrence being represented with matrix, RecurrenceEvaluator can evaluate recurrence's values in fully functional stream-like and efficient manner.
Thorough usage of Splititerator (JAVA 8) allowed to use stream object in parallel.
